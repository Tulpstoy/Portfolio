          <p>
            I love to write and read. Whether it's creative writing, technical documentation, 
            or diving into a good book, I find that storytelling and clear communication are 
            essential skills in development. Every piece of code tells a story, and I believe 
            in making that story accessible and engaging for users.
          </p>
          <p>
            My reading spans from fiction to technical books, and I find that this diversity 
            helps me think creatively about problem-solving and user experience design.

          <p>
            I've been playing The Sims since I was a kid, and it's more than just a game to me. 
            It's where I first learned about user interface design, user experience, and the 
            importance of creating intuitive, enjoyable experiences for users.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Sims taught me about building systems, managing complexity, and creating 
            interfaces that feel natural and engaging. These lessons directly influence how 
            I approach web development today.

          <h2 className="section-title"><span className="emoji">üí°</span> From Sims to Code</h2>
          <p>
            My journey from playing The Sims to becoming a developer wasn't a straight line, 
            but it makes perfect sense to me. Both involve creating systems, solving problems, 
            and thinking about how users interact with interfaces.
          </p>
          <p>
            The attention to detail, the focus on user experience, and the joy of creating 
            something that others can use and enjoy - these are the threads that connect my 
            personal interests to my professional work.

          <p>
            I have cats, and they're a constant reminder of the importance of patience, 
            observation, and understanding different perspectives. They also provide excellent 
            debugging companionship - there's nothing like explaining a problem to a cat to 
            help you think through it clearly!
